Hey everyone, Thami here aka [Arch]Yoshi, I am passionate software craftsman currently working at [La Combe Du Lion Vert](http://la-combe-du-lion-vert.fr/), an awesome company by the way (contact me if you're developer to and want to level up your career by joining us).
I love learning best practices, improve my knowledge, read and discover new things, whether it's languages, frameworks, or simply new features in languages.

I mainly work in java, and recently I started learning python. And I am interested in lot of other things, so follow me and let's improve and make better programs together.

This site is going to be my place for sharing content I create with all of you â˜º
